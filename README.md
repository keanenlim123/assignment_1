# Design Process
I wanted to go for a professional yet friendly and trustworthy website. To went for this look i set most of the images to a game theme also i set eye capturing hero images at the start of the page and when scrolling they would see a lot of details of the website.

overall - I show different ways they can get a gold of us by phone, email or location. The navigation collapses into a hambuger menu which  upon clicking they could access the navigation as it pops from the right of the page.

Homepage - I set as little content as possible so that the user will feel curious about the company. I have content below that access the other pages through buttons.

About us - The about us page explains more and goes into more details about the company showing the mission, values and goals about the company. To show credibility and legitimacy of the website, i added pictures of the company professional team of our team with name and a short description of what they do. The showcase displays the past game created by clients, by doing this new users can get a preview of what they are going to do and each of the 3 games can be played by clicking on the "Try Me!" button. Showing the coding languages also helps by giving a preview of what we use to code our games.

Services - The services page goes into more detail as this is essentially when the sign want to sign up for our company. We display the testimonials if they still had doubts about the website, this increases the trustworthyness showing pass review of our clients. The membership section is where they could see the plan they want to get with all the benefits that comes with it before paying. I design the button to fit the price as i felt that the benefits took lots of space and if i had added the price it would look ugly.

Payment - After the user click on the plan they want they can see the form which they will fill in their details. And it does validate the user input and also add a entry for local storage.

# Features
